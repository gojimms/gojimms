          <p class="lead" id="intro">
            In today’s digital era, computers have become an inseparable part of modern life.
            Many activities—learning, working, communicating, and even accessing public services—
            involve computers directly or indirectly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Computers are no longer “just tools.” They are a foundation behind many modern systems.
            Without computers, a lot of processes would be slower, less efficient, and sometimes difficult to execute.
          </p>

          <h2 id="definition">What Is a Computer?</h2>

          <p>
            In general, a computer is an electronic device that receives data (<em>input</em>),
            processes it based on instructions (<em>process</em>), and produces useful results (<em>output</em>).
            In addition, computers can store data so it can be accessed again later.
          </p>

          <p>
            With these capabilities, computers help people make decisions, complete tasks,
            and manage information faster and more accurately.
          </p>

          <h2 id="core-functions">Core Functions of a Computer</h2>

          <p>
            In practice, computers serve several essential functions, including:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Processing data into useful information.</li>
            <li>Storing large amounts of data and documents.</li>
            <li>Supporting digital communication such as email and online meetings.</li>
            <li>Enabling learning and entertainment.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            These functions make computers useful across many fields—from education and business
            to government services.
          </p>

          <h2 id="main-components">Main Components of a Computer</h2>

          <p>
            For a computer to work properly, it consists of several key components that work together:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Hardware</strong><br />
              Physical components such as monitor, keyboard, mouse, and CPU—things you can see and touch.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Software</strong><br />
              Programs and operating systems that control how the computer works, including applications used by the user.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Brainware</strong><br />
              People—the users who operate and make use of the computer for specific needs.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            These three elements must work together so a computer can function effectively.
          </p>

          <h2 id="daily-role">How Computers Help in Daily Life</h2>

          <p>
            Computers play a major role in improving efficiency and productivity.
            In education, computers make it easier to access digital learning and information sources.
            In the workplace, they speed up data processing, team communication, and documentation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Even in everyday activities—shopping, administration, and entertainment—computers are the backbone
            behind the digital services people use today.
          </p>

          <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

          <p>
            Computers are not just technology devices—they have become an essential need in modern life.
            By understanding their definition, functions, and role, we can use computers more effectively
            and responsibly to support our daily activities.
          </p>
